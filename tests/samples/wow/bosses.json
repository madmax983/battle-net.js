He single-handedly slaughtered the defenders, but suffered a grave injury that left him incapable of following the Horde when it later stormed Azeroth. Now recovered, Porung serves Warchief Kargath Bladefist in Hellfire Citadel, hoping to make up for the glorious battles he has missed and write his name in orcish history with the blood of his enemies.",
